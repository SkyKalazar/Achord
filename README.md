# Achord

## The motive

So, I am playing an acoustic guitar on a beginner level. Spent about 40 hours so far. With university specifically and life in general being in the way, I find it difficult to dedicate time to it and develop. And a hectic practicing schedule doesn’t really amount to much as the fingers become quite unhappy quite fast on metal strings. Furthermore, the infrequent schedule makes the progress sluggish at best - trying to remember what song I was learning and what specific part was giving me trouble can be… troublesome.
	So the idea is to have an application that would help me track and feel the progress. I want to be able to add songs that I am currently learning, their lyrics, make adjustments and comments in terms of chords and strumming/fingering patterns (or just some remarks, insights). I want to be able to filter through the songs based on latest entries or titles. Also would want to be able to write using both the english and the russian alphabet. I want to be able to log how much time I have spent on each song (I already have a general time tracker, but it is rather difficult to have it more specific than just “playing guitar”). And I want to be able to add videos to those entries - either instructional videos that I found useful or recordings of myself playing/singing the song. I think it would be curious to look back and see how my playing style and skill had changed. Might also be nice to have like a chords’ glossary where I could upload a picture of me assuming that chord or playing some lick. If there will be a lot of songs, I want to be able to set favorites or “projects”. Also rating their difficulty (based on my own subjective perception of it). And later on I would want to be able to group them into music styles - in case I have a lot of songs and sometime in the far future I would be as fancy as to practice specific musical genres.
